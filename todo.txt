1. When any of the field is empty for a record, load existing output image if there is
    resize the image if the size does not match. Then update only the missing algorithm result.
2. Multi Exposure dataset result parser
3. SICE dataset result parser
4. Implement a contrast sorter for label images, so that we can divide high contrast and low contrast scenes
    then analyze scene constrast factor
    (may be beneficial for examining light sources / light power / light positions and rotations)
5. Implement a saturation sorter for label images, so that we can divide high saturation and low saturation scenes
    then analyze scene saturation factor
    (may be beneficial for examining scene/object color variety and weather conditions (foggy, cloudy, clear))
6. Implement a brightness sorter for label images, so that we can divide darker scenes and lighter scenes
    then analyze scene brightness factor
    (may be beneficial for examining natural/artificial light sources, open and closed scenes, day/night comparison)
